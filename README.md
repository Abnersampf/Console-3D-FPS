NOTE: The gif is accelerated, the real game runs at a very low fps rate

This project is a very important achievement, I never thought I would be able to do something like this. It's not perfect, far from it, but it's an absurd evolution compared to the first console application game I made (the snake game). The snake game has over 530 lines of code and is not at all impressive, whereas this 3D game has 246 lines and is much more complex and cool to see.

And why am I saying that I thought I couldn't make this program? Because my goal was to create this program without having to search for tutorials on the internet. There are several tutorials that teach how to make this "3D game," and it would be easy to do it after watching them, but I didn't want that. I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it without any help. After all, the first 3D game in the world had to be invented by someone who didn't have much reference at the time, so why couldn't I?

The only thing I researched was the formula for the equation of the line, and nothing else. I had to adapt it for my program and do everything else. All the ideas came from my head, I didn't search anywhere, no videos, images, documentation, etc.
